# Car Auctions

## Project Description

This project was created following Neil Cummings's Udemy course, "Build a Microservices App with .Net and NextJS from Scratch." In the ever-evolving web development landscape, microservices have become a pivotal skill. 
It's a microservices-based auction web app for cars using .Net for backend services and Next.js for the client app.

## Key Features

- **Backend Services**: Develop several backend services using .Net to provide core functionalities.
- **Service Communication**: Implement RabbitMQ and gRPC for efficient service-to-service communication.
- **Identity Management**: Utilize IdentityServer as the identity provider for authentication.
- **Gateway Creation**: Build a gateway using Microsoft YARP to manage API traffic.
- **Client App**: Create a client-side app with Next.js, leveraging the new App Router functionality introduced in Next.js 13.4.
- **Real-time Updates**: Use SignalR for real-time push notifications to the client app.
- **Dockerization**: Dockerize all services to ensure consistent and reproducible deployments.
- **CI/CD**: Set up CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions for streamlined development and deployment.
- **Ingress Controllers**: Add ingress controllers to manage external access to the services.
- **Local Deployment**: Publish the app locally using Docker Compose, avoiding the need for paid cloud services.

## App Functions

This auction web app for cars includes the following features:

- **User Registration and Login**: Secure user registration and authentication.
- **Auction Management**: Create and manage car auctions.
- **Bidding System**: Place bids on auctions, with validation to prevent bidding on one's own auctions.
- **Field Validations**: Ensure data integrity during auction creation and bidding.
- **Pagination, Filtering, and Ordering**: Navigate and manage auction listings efficiently.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for specific auctions.

## Summary

This project encapsulates modern web development practices, emphasizing microservices architecture, real-time communication, and robust authentication mechanisms. By following this course, you gain practical experience in building, deploying, and managing a sophisticated web application using cutting-edge technologies.
